              <h3>Development of KPI Reports for the team.</h3>
              <p>My team has been struggling with the record keeping of the monthly action
                  items, so I took the advantage of python and draft something that
                  helps the team not to worry about manual records. The
                  program list all the action items that the team have worked on for
                  the previous month and records the dates based on the changes made
                  in the action item, the team used to record this manually at the
                  end of each month for reporting purposes.</p>
